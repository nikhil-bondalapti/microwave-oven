# Microwave Oven Project using PIC Microcontroller

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **Microwave Oven** using a **PIC Microcontroller**, featuring essential functionalities like **time setting, power control, door status detection, and safety mechanisms**. The project is designed to work with **PICSIMLAB** and can be implemented using real hardware.

## Features
✅ **LCD Display** – Shows cooking time, power level, and status  
✅ **Keypad Input** – Allows users to set cooking time and power levels  
✅ **Start/Stop Button** – Controls microwave operation  
✅ **Door Sensor** – Ensures the oven operates only when the door is closed  
✅ **Buzzer Alert** – Notifies when cooking is complete  
✅ **Safety Mechanisms** – Prevents overheating and incorrect usage  

## Hardware & Software Used
- **Microcontroller:** PIC (e.g., PIC16F877A)  
- **Simulation:** PICSIMLAB  
- **Compiler:** MPLAB XC8  
- **Programming Language:** Embedded C  
- **Display:** 16x4 LCD  
- **Input:** 4x4 Keypad  
- **Additional Components:** Buzzer, Relay, LED Indicators  

## How It Works
1. **User Input:** The user enters the cooking time and power level using the keypad.  
2. **Door Check:** The system verifies that the door is closed before starting.  
3. **Cooking Process:** The microcontroller controls the heating mechanism using relays based on the selected power level.  
4. **Time Countdown:** The LCD displays the remaining time.
