#Microwave Oven Project using PIC Microcontroller
Project Overview

This project simulates a Microwave Oven using a PIC Microcontroller, featuring essential functionalities like time setting, power control, door status detection, and safety mechanisms. The project is designed to work with PICSIMLAB and can be implemented using real hardware.
Features

✅ LCD Display – Shows cooking time, power level, and status
✅ Keypad Input – Allows users to set cooking time and power levels
✅ Start/Stop Button – Controls microwave operation
✅ Door Sensor – Ensures the oven operates only when the door is closed
✅ Buzzer Alert – Notifies when cooking is complete
✅ Safety Mechanisms – Prevents overheating and incorrect usage
Hardware & Software Used

    Microcontroller: PIC (e.g., PIC16F877A)
    Simulation: PICSIMLAB
    Compiler: MPLAB XC8
    Programming Language: Embedded C
    Display: 16x2 LCD
    Input: 4x4 Keypad
    Additional Components: Buzzer, Relay, LED Indicators

How It Works

    User Input: The user enters the cooking time and power level using the keypad.
    Door Check: The system verifies that the door is closed before starting.
    Cooking Process: The microcontroller controls the heating mechanism using relays based on the selected power level.
    Time Countdown: The LCD displays the remaining time.
